# platform-templates

Three Cubes platform engineering — reusable composite actions, shared workflows, and Bicep modules for cross-repo CI/CD standardisation.

**The one true consumer today is [tc-agent-zone](https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-agent-zone)'s deploy-on-merge pipeline** — it calls `azure-vm-deploy.yml@v1` to snapshot → apply → smoke `vm-openclaw` (and `vm-hermes-poc`) on every merge to `main`. Treat that seam as load-bearing: the workflow's `workflow_call` inputs/secrets/permissions are a stable contract.

**The premise:** every Three Cubes repo that deploys to Azure VMs should be doing it the same way. This repo holds that "same way" as code — composite actions for atoms (snapshot, WIF login, apply via run-command, smoke check), reusable workflows for end-to-end patterns, and Bicep modules for the Azure-side identity setup. Consumer repos call into these instead of re-implementing.

This repo gates itself with the org `meta-quality-gate` reusable (`.github/workflows/self-ci.yml`) — the framework/non-Python gate shape: actionlint + yamllint over the workflows and composite actions, `az bicep build` over the Bicep, plus `license_present` and `branch_naming`.

## Quick start (new consumer repo)

```bash
# 1. Provision the WIF identity for your repo (one-time, ~2 min)
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group RG-AGENTS-CORE \
  --template-file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/three-cubes/platform-templates/v1/infra/bicep/ci-deploy-identity.bicep \
  --parameters repoOwner=three-cubes repoName=YOUR-REPO keyVaultName=kv-tc-agents

# 2. Populate GitHub repo variables from the outputs
CLIENT_ID=$(az deployment group show --name ci-deploy-identity \
  -g RG-AGENTS-CORE --query 'properties.outputs.clientId.value' -o tsv)
TENANT_ID=$(az deployment group show --name ci-deploy-identity \
  -g RG-AGENTS-CORE --query 'properties.outputs.tenantId.value' -o tsv)
SUB_ID=$(az deployment group show --name ci-deploy-identity \
  -g RG-AGENTS-CORE --query 'properties.outputs.subscriptionId.value' -o tsv)

gh variable set AZURE_CLIENT_ID --body "$CLIENT_ID" --repo three-cubes/YOUR-REPO
gh variable set AZURE_TENANT_ID --body "$TENANT_ID" --repo three-cubes/YOUR-REPO
gh variable set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --body "$SUB_ID" --repo three-cubes/YOUR-REPO

# 3. Create the production environment
gh api -X PUT /repos/three-cubes/YOUR-REPO/environments/production --silent

# 4. Add a thin workflow file in your repo that calls the shared workflow
#    See docs/MIGRATION.md for the exact shape.
```

## Versioning

This repo uses simple major tags (`v1`, `v2`, etc.). Consumer repos pin to a major tag and we ratchet breaking changes through major bumps. Patches/improvements within `v1` are picked up automatically next CI run.
