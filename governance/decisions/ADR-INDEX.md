# ADR-INDEX — every ADR across the paved road, in one place

The cross-repo view that [`ADR-POLICY.md`](ADR-POLICY.md) makes possible. It lists the org-level
register (canonical here) plus every **product** ADR across tc-agent-zone, kairix, and kata by its
org-unique **alias** (`TAZ-ADR-###` / `KAI-ADR-###` / `KATA-ADR-###`), so a decision can be named
unambiguously without any repo renumbering.

**How to read it.** *Home repo / home path* is where the record lives and is owned; the alias is the
stable cross-repo handle (see `ADR-POLICY.md` §Decision). Status is the value declared in the ADR's
own frontmatter/header at the scan date (`—` = the ADR does not declare a status). This index is
**hand-maintained today**; SGO-179 adds a small in-repo walker (`docs/decisions/INDEX.md` per repo)
that generates the per-repo slice mechanically.

> **Scan basis (2026-07-02).** Ranges reflect what is actually on disk in each repo's `record_dir`,
> which supersedes the approximate ranges in the tracking issues: tc-agent-zone `docs/decisions/`
> **ADR-001..046** (011–012 unused), kairix `docs/architecture/` **ADR-017..036** (033–034 unused),
> kata `docs/adr/` **ADR-001..013**. Plus the tc-agent-zone `docs/architecture/` collision pair,
> pending migration.

## Org-level register (home: tc-pipelines)

Canonical in this repo, prefixed IDs, **not** `ADR-###`. Full statements + sources of record are in
[`ADR-POLICY.md`](ADR-POLICY.md#the-org-level-register-canonical-here):

`STD-IDENTITY` · `STD-MERGE` · `RULESET-D1` · `CODEOWNERS-D1` · `GATE-HARDEN` · `QG-CONVERGE` ·
`SONAR-HANDOFF` · `MUT-RATCHET` · `DEP-D1` · `REPO-MERGE` · `VERS-D1` · `WIF-D1..D5` · `COST-D1/2`.

Accepted target decisions under implementation are `SDLC-PRODUCT-D1`,
`SDLC-GRAPH-D1` and `SDLC-CATALOGUE-D1`. Their implementation state is recorded
separately in `ADR-POLICY.md`; they do not redefine the in-force IDs above.

### tc-agent-zone — `docs/architecture/` (collision pair, pending migration)

These two records live in a *second* directory and are the one real `adr_number_unique` violation
(`adr-013` clashes with `docs/decisions/ADR-013`). They are slated to move into `docs/decisions/` at
fresh next-free numbers (**≥ 047**) via `git mv` under **SGO-176**; aliases are withheld until then.

## Collisions & follow-ups (owned elsewhere)

This index is **additive**; the fixes below are tracked on their own issues and are out of scope for
these new `governance/decisions/` files:

1. **tc-agent-zone `ADR-013` cross-directory collision** — `docs/decisions/ADR-013` vs
   `docs/architecture/adr-013`. Remediation: SGO-179 hardens `adr_number_unique` (list of
   `record_dirs` + case-insensitive prefix, with a regression fixture from this collision); SGO-176
   `git mv`s both `docs/architecture` ADRs into `docs/decisions/` at fresh numbers **≥ 047** and
   sweeps inbound references. Aliases `TAZ-ADR-047/048` are reserved for them.
2. **kata `ADR-013` vs `STD-MERGE`** — kata's merge-governance ADR overlaps the org `STD-MERGE`
   decision; reconcile via a superseded-by/amendment banner on the kata ADR pointing at the
   tc-pipelines `STD-MERGE` record (SGO-176).
3. **Per-repo `INDEX.md` walkers** — SGO-179 adds a small generator so each repo emits its own slice
   of this table mechanically, keeping the hand-maintained view honest.
