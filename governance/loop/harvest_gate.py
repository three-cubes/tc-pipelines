"""Harvest-present close-invariant for the autonomous-delivery loop (SP-C-6 / PLA-314).

Promotes ADR-038 (harvest-then-decay / harvest-before-destroy) into a CORE
close-invariant: an ADP work item may not sit in a terminal ``done``/``completed``
state unless it carries a distilled **harvest artifact** — the structured record
of what shipped, the verification result, and the key decisions — recorded on the
issue BEFORE the close transition. No close / teardown without a harvest.

This is the machine-checkable predicate half of the invariant that
``.github/workflows/verify-and-close.yml`` enforces at run time (it distils +
posts the harvest comment, and REFUSES to close if the harvest cannot be
recorded). Keeping the predicate here, next to the loop state machine, means the
spec, the workflow, and this check cannot drift: all three key off the SAME
provenance-stamped marker.

The harvest marker embedded in every artifact is, canonically::

    <!-- adp-harvest issue=<ISSUE-ID> -->

Provenance-stamped (issue id) and idempotent: the marker keys on the issue id, so
a re-run detects the existing harvest and never double-records, and a harvest
stamped for a DIFFERENT issue never satisfies this one. Keep this format
byte-identical to the marker the HARVEST step writes in the workflow.

Stdlib only, no network — matching the determinism the loop harness enforces.
