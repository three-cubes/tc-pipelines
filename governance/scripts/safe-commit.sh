#!/usr/bin/env bash
# safe-commit.sh — commit only if the canonical gate passes. Repo-agnostic.
#
# Current compatibility implementation of the Three Cubes inner-loop contract:
#   uv run pre-commit run [--all-files]   (cheap hygiene: lint/format/actionlint/
#                                           shell-lint/secret-scan/no-attribution)
#   uv run tc-fitness run   [--staged]     (the fitness catalogue: typing, honest
#                                           coverage, mutation, architecture)
# — then commit only on green. The tc-sdlc migration replaces this sequence with
# the released preparation and task graph. The fitness catalogue remains in
# tc-fitness and repository-specific tasks remain in the consumer declaration.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/safe-commit.sh "commit message"            # full gate (the merge bar)
#   bash scripts/safe-commit.sh --check "commit message"    # warm staged inner loop
#   bash scripts/safe-commit.sh --fast  "commit message"    # hygiene-only fast path
#   bash scripts/safe-commit.sh --pre-pr                    # verify-only full replay (no commit)
#   bash scripts/safe-commit.sh --help
#
# Modes:
#   (default)  uv run pre-commit run --all-files  +  uv run tc-fitness run        -> commit
#   --check    uv run pre-commit run (staged)     +  uv run tc-fitness run --staged -> commit
#              The warm, staged-scoped inner loop. Warm-daemon mypy (dmypy) is
#              OPTIONAL and repo-configured — wire it as a pre-commit hook if you
#              want it; this script does not hardcode any type checker.
#   --fast     uv run pre-commit run (staged)                                     -> commit
#              Hygiene-only, for commits that genuinely can't touch the product
#              surface (workflow YAML, docs, config tweaks). The full gate is
#              still the merge bar; --fast is just the iteration loop.
#   --pre-pr   uv run pre-commit run --all-files  +  uv run tc-fitness run        -> VERIFY ONLY
#              The pre-push confirmation. Commits nothing, needs nothing staged.
#              Run it after the normal gate has committed, before you push.
#
# Escape hatch: SAFE_COMMIT_SKIP_COVERAGE=1 appends `--skip-coverage` to the
# tc-fitness invocation (the neutral generalisation of the old per-repo
# KAIRIX_SKIP_COVERAGE). Do NOT push a commit whose gate only passed because
# coverage was skipped — CI still enforces it.
