# Changelog

All notable changes to `three-cubes/tc-pipelines` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
for the consumer-facing `@vN` workflow/action references.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`require-work-item` reusable workflow (PLA-313 / SP-C-5).** The fail-closed
  merge-boundary enforcement of the invariant **NO WORK WITHOUT A WORK ITEM**:
  [`.github/workflows/require-work-item.yml`](.github/workflows/require-work-item.yml)
  (`workflow_call`) FAILS a PR unless its head branch (org convention
  `<user>/<team>-<number>-<slug>`) or body resolves to a **real, open/in-progress**
  Linear issue, verified via the Linear GraphQL API using the KV-fetched key
  (secret-free via WIF, like `verify-and-close`). Bypasses: a **human maintainer**
  author, or an explicit `no-work-item` label with a rationale **and** a
  CODEOWNERS-gated (code-owner-approved) sign-off for genuine hotfixes.
  Fail-closed: an unresolved id or an unreadable work-item source blocks the PR.
  Publishes the stable required-status-check context **`require-work-item`** for a
  ruleset to gate on. Injection-safe (every input + `github.event.*` env-bound;
  GraphQL via `jq --arg`). Docs:
  [`governance/loop/require-work-item.md`](governance/loop/require-work-item.md);
  static call-graph shapes added to `example-callers.yml`.
- **Canonical per-agent GitHub App governance (SGO-163).** Promoted from
  tc-agent-zone into `governance/`: the per-agent App set
  [`governance/agent-app-manifests/`](governance/agent-app-manifests/)
  (`tc-agent-builder`/`shape`/`consultant`/`growth`, tiered permissions with the
  `Administration=read` / `Secrets=none` HITL boundary intact) and the
  [`governance/agent-sdlc-access-and-hitl.md`](governance/agent-sdlc-access-and-hitl.md)
  standard (capability vs enforcement). Indexed from `STANDARDS.md` §4 +
  `governance/README.md`.

### Changed

- **`example-callers.yml` de-serialised one-file-per-reusable (parallel-dev
  friction fix).** The monolithic self-check every reusable's PR appended to (and
  collided on) is split: each reusable now owns an `example-<reusable>.yml`
  `workflow_call` file that statically validates its own call shape, and
  `example-callers.yml` is a thin `workflow_dispatch` dispatcher that fans
  `run-for-real` out to them. Adding a reusable adds a NEW file instead of editing
  a shared one, so additions no longer serialize. Every existing example job and
  the run-for-real gating are preserved; actionlint + yamllint stay green.
- **`agent-token` CLI + `github-app-token` action are per-agent-parametrised
  (SGO-163).** The CLI gains `--agent builder|shape|consultant|growth` (resolving
  the `github-app-<agent>-{id,key}` vault secrets and discovering the installation
  from the App JWT), a `--repo` installation scope, and `--git-config` (sets
  `git user.name/email` to the App's `[bot]` identity on mint). The composite
  action gains an allowlisted `agent:` input mapping to the same secret contract.
  Both default to the canonical `three-cubes-agent` App when unset — backward
  compatible with existing consumers. (`tc-agent-tools` → 0.2.0.)

### Added

- **`github-app-token` composite action** (`.github/actions/github-app-token`) —
  mints a short-lived GitHub App installation token for the `three-cubes-agent`
  App by reading its App ID + private key from `kv-tc-agents` over WIF, so agents
  authenticate as their own App identity with no GitHub-stored secret. Outputs
  `token` / `app-slug` / `installation-id`. Prereq: the consumer's WIF identity
  has Key Vault Secrets User on the vault (`ci-deploy-identity.bicep keyVaultName=…`).

### Changed

- **`python-quality-gate.yml` now calls the fitness engine.** The reusable
  Python gate shrinks to `checkout → setup-uv-cached → uv run tc-fitness run`.
  The gate's STEPS (ruff/bandit/mypy/pytest/coverage/detect-secrets targets and
  the run-* toggles) are no longer workflow inputs — each consuming repo
  declares them in a repo-local `[tool.tc_fitness]` config that the engine
  reads. The same binary + config is what `make check` runs locally, so
  local == CI by construction. Removed inputs: `ruff-lint-paths`,
  `ruff-lint-args`, `ruff-format-paths`, `bandit-paths`, `bandit-args`,
  `mypy-paths`, `mypy-args`, `compileall-paths`, `shellcheck-find-paths`,
  `pytest-args`, `coverage-paths`, `coverage-fail-under`,
  `normalize-coverage-script`, `detect-secrets-baseline`, and all Python-step
  `run-*` toggles. Added inputs: `tc-fitness-args`, `pre-steps`, `post-steps`,
  `upload-coverage-artifact`, `coverage-xml-path`, `coverage-artifact-name`.
  The Node/TS half (`run-node` + pnpm/node inputs) is retained — a separate
  ecosystem the Python engine does not orchestrate.
- **`python-quality-gate.yml` now uploads the engine-produced coverage XML**
  as the `coverage-data` artifact, completing the artifact-handoff to
  `sonar-scan.yml` from within the converged single job.
- Self-pinned both composites and the reusable gate to
  `three-cubes/tc-pipelines/actions/setup-uv-cached@v1` (was `@main`),
  honouring the repo's own "pin @vN" principle.

### Added

- **`meta-quality-gate.yml`** — the reusable self-CI gate for framework /
  non-Python repos (the second org GHA shape, complementing
  `python-quality-gate.yml`). Toggleable legs: actionlint, yamllint (relaxed
  org config), a top-level LICENSE/SPDX assertion, and branch naming. All
  caller inputs are env-bound before any shell body (injection-safe).
- **`actions/license-present`** — single-sourced composite asserting a
  top-level LICENSE file declares the expected SPDX id (whole-repo provenance,
  distinct from the engine's per-file header check). Drives the meta gate's
  license leg.
- **ci-workflows dogfoods its own meta gate** — the self-check `ci.yml` now
  thin-calls `./.github/workflows/meta-quality-gate.yml` (local-path ref)
  instead of three inline actionlint/yamllint/license jobs, so the repo runs the
  gate it ships.
- **`example-callers.yml` now exercises `python-quality-gate.yml`** via a
  kairix-shaped and a taz-shaped static caller — closing the only reusable
  `workflow_call` contract not previously validated by the call-graph self-check.
- `LICENSE` — Apache-2.0 (was an undeclared `Proprietary` marker on a public
  repo). Matched across `fitness-engine` and `platform-templates`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Self-CI: `yamllint` over the workflows/actions and a LICENSE-presence
  assertion, alongside the existing `actionlint` pass.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-22

### Changed

- **Renamed `ci-workflows` → `tc-pipelines`** and **merged in `platform-templates`**
  (history-preserving) — one repo under the Three Cubes Golden Path for both the
  CI/quality reusables and the Azure-VM deploy reusables. Consumers pin
  `tc-pipelines@v1` (the `v1` floating major moved to the merged HEAD).

### Added

- Azure-VM deploy surfaces from the former `platform-templates`:
  `azure-vm-deploy.yml`, the `wif-azure-login` / `snapshot-azure-vm-disk` /
  `apply-on-vm-via-runcommand` / `smoke-systemctl` composites, and
  `infra/bicep/ci-deploy-identity.bicep`. Internal `uses:` refs are
  self-contained within `tc-pipelines` (no cross-repo reach into the archived
  `platform-templates`).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-14

First tagged baseline of the org-shared CI surface (kairix#499 Phase 4).

### Added

- Reusable workflows: `python-quality-gate.yml`, `sonar-scan.yml`,
  `release.yml`, `mutation-gate.yml`, `docker-build-publish.yml`,
  `fresh-install-smoke.yml`, and the `example-callers.yml` static
  call-graph self-check.
- Composite actions: `setup-uv-cached` (pinned uv + cached venv install seam)
  and `pre-commit-cached` (synced venv + pre-commit run).
- `ci.yml` self-check running `actionlint`.
